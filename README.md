## Software Engineering application

Thank you for considering my application for the software engineering role. I have invested a significant amount of time and effort into this assessment, and although the final submitted code may not be complete, I believe it showcases my abilities within the given timeframe.

## Features of the Final solution

-   The codebase is written in TypeScript, utilizing React for the front-end and some basic Firebase functions for the backend.
-   The React Context API was employed for inter-component state management, promoting efficient data sharing.
-   Styling was achieved using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive UI (well almost).
-   Formik was used for form handling and validation, enhancing the user experience with smooth form interactions.
-   Other libraries, such as React Icons for icons, Sonner for notifications, and React Router DOM for routing, were also utilized to improve various aspects of the application.

## How to run the Application

1. After obtaining access to the codebase, you can either provide your Firebase API keys or use the ones provided within the codebase (this is only applicable to employers)
2. Install the project dependencies using npm or pnpm, the package manager I prefer:

```bash

pnpm install

```

Please note that npm can still be used if preferred over pnpm.

3. To start the application in your browser, run the following script:

```bash

pnpm run dev

```

This will initiate the development server and make the application accessible in your browser.

## Final Note of Gratitude

Once again, I extend my gratitude for considering my application. The challenge of building something meaningful within just 7 days was exhilarating, and while certain components in this solution may not be fully completed, I firmly believe that it demonstrates my passion and dedication to software engineering. Given more time and resources, I am confident that I can further enhance this project and create even more remarkable applications in the future. Thank you for the opportunity!
